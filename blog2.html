    <h2> Chromite </h2>
    <img src="./images/chromite.webp" alt="chromite" width="500" height="300">
<p> <b> Chromite images show a dark, metallic-looking mineral, often appearing as gray or black rocks with a dull, sometimes rusty, surface. It is an important ore, primarily used to produce ferrochrome for stainless steel, and can be found in large deposits in volcanic and igneous rocks. 
<h2>Visual characteristics</h2></b>
<p> <b> Color:</b> Appears dark gray or black.<br><br> 
<b>Surface:</b> Often has a dull or rusty appearance.<br><br>
<b> Texture</b>: Can be found in both large rocks and crushed chunks.<br><br> 
<b> Inclusions</b>: May show black inclusions on its surface.<br> <br>
<b>Structure:</b> It is a double oxide of iron and chromium, belonging to the spinel group of minerals.</p><br><br>  
<h2>Where it's found</h2> 
<b>Geological location</b>: Primarily found in large reef deposits within layered igneous intrusions.<br><br> 
<b>Associated rocks</b>: Occurs in various volcanic and igneous rocks. <br> <br>
<b> Industrial and commercial context</b><br><br>
<b>Primary use :</b> The main source of chromium for the metallurgical industry, especially for producing stainless steel.<br><br> 
<b>Other uses:</b> Also used in the chemical industry for various products like dyes, tanning, and as an oxidant.<br><br> 
<b>Mining:</b> Images from mining operations show the raw ore being dug up and processed into smaller pieces. </p><br> <br>
 </p>
<h2>Economic importance</h2>
<p>Chromite is economically significant due to its role as the primary source of chromium, which is essential for producing stainless steel and various alloys. The demand for stainless steel in construction, automotive, and manufacturing industries drives the mining and export of chromite, making it a valuable mineral in the global market.</p>
