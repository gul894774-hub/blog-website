    <h1> Gypsum </h1>
    <img src="./images/g3.webp" width="500" height="300">
    <p>Gypsum is an important non-metallic mineral found in various parts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, especially in Kohat and
        D.I. Khan districts. It is mainly used in cement, plaster of Paris, and fertilizer industries. The high-quality
        gypsum of KPK plays a vital role in supporting both local manufacturing and national construction
        projects.Gypsum is a soft sulfate mineral, chemically hydrated calcium sulfate that is widely used in
        construction as the main ingredient in plaster and drywall. It is also used in agriculture as a soil conditioner
        and fertilizer, and it has various other applications, including in food, pharmaceuticals, and decorative arts.
        The mineral is found in various forms, including clear crystals (selenite), fibrous masses (satin spar), and
        fine-grained masses (alabaster).
    <h2>  Uses of gypsum</h2>
    <b> Construction:</b> As a primary component in plaster of Paris and drywall, gypsum is used for walls, ceilings,
    and floors, providing fire resistance, sound insulation, and humidity regulation. It is also used as a set retarderin cement production.<br><br>
    <b>Agriculture: </b>It is used as a fertilizer and soil conditioner to correct compacted or clayey
    soils and to provide calcium and sulfur to crops. It can also help counteract excessive salinity in soil without
    affecting its pH.<br><br>
    <b>Medical:</b> Gypsum is used in making surgical casts to immobilize<br><br>
    <b> Industrial and Food:</b> Gypsum is a food additive in products like bread, beer, and tofu, and is used in some
    medications and toothpaste. It is also a flux in the smelting of nickel ores and a filler in paper and
    paints.<br><br>
    <b>Decorative and Artistic:</b> Its various forms are used in sculpture and ornamental objects. For example, the
    fine-grained variety, alabaster, is carved and polished, while the silky, fibrous variety, satin spar, is used for
    ornaments and jewelry.<br><br>
    <b> Properties and forms </b>Composition: Hydrated calcium sulfate, with the chemical formula. The related mineral
    anhydrite is chemically similar but lacks the water molecules.Appearance: Typically white, gray, or colorless in its
    massive form. Crystals can be clear, transparent, or translucent. Impurities can cause it to appear red, brown, or
    yellow.Hardness: It is a very soft mineral, with a hardness of 2 on the Mohs scale.<br><br>
    <b>Forms:</b> Selenite: Well-developed, clear crystals.Satin Spar: Fibrous, silky masses that are
    opalescent.Alabaster: Fine-grained, massive variety that is often translucent.Gypsite: An earthy, powdery variety.
