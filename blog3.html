    <p>Limestone is one of the most abundant and important minerals found in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK). It is widely used in cement manufacturing, construction, and industrial processes. Districts like Dera Ismail Khan, Nowshera, and Kohat have rich limestone reserves. Its easy availability and high quality make it a key contributor to the regionâ€™s mining Limestone is a type of carbonate sedimentary rock which is the main source of the material lime. It is composed mostly of the minerals calcite and aragonite, which are different crystal forms of calcium carbonate CaCO3. Limestone forms when these minerals precipitate out of water containing dissolved calcium. This can take place through both biological and nonbiological processes, though biological processes, such as the accumulation of corals and shells in the sea, have likely been more important for the last 540 million years.[1][2] Limestone often contains fossils which provide scientists with information on ancient environments and on the evolution of life.[3]sector.</p>
